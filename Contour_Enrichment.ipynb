    "fd_contour_inputs = fr\"{gdb_working}\\ContourInputs\"\n",

    "contour_years = [\"2001\", \"2007\", \"2011\", \"2015\", \"2019\", \"2020\"]\n",
    "```\n",

    "- `fc_watershed` - a feature class containing a Hydrological Units feature class\n",
    "    - this should be the longest digit feature class available (i.e. HUC12)\n",
    "    - this feature class may be additionally enriched to contain data relevant to the shorter digit features (i.e. HUC10, HUC8, etc.)\n",
    "- `fc_grid` - a feature class containing the US National Grid at the desired scale\n",
    "- `contour_years` - a list corresponding to the number of Contour feature classes within the `fd_contour_inputs` feature dataset\n",
    "    - the naming convention used is `\"Contours_\"` with the year immediately following like: `\"Contours_2022\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Workflow\n",
    "This notebook is fairly straight-forward; using a loop it proceeds through a series of geoprocessing tasks within the ArcPy `\"memory\"` environment. The processing is memory-intensive but is significantly faster than performed using traditional writes on the file geodatabase.\n",
    "- converts the enrichment data `fc_watershed`, `fc_grid` to memory feature classes, and the `contour` data to a memory feature class as well\n",
    "- intersects the `contour` memory feature class against both the enrichment data feature classes in turn\n",
    "    - creates a *multi-point geometry* output for `fc_watershed` as `mem_multi_intersect01`\n",
    "    - creates a *multi-point geometry* output for `fc_grid` as `mem_multi_intersect02`\n",
    "- the *multi-point* geometry output above is consolidated into a single memory feature class through an append method into `mem_multi_intersect01` as the target feature class\n",
    "- the *multi-point* geometry is converted into *point geometry* within `mem_point_intersects`\n",
    "- `mem_point_intersects` is then used to split the `contour` data within `mem_contours_split`\n",
    "    - this makes sure that contours are split at each USNG tile and again at any water boundary (sub-watershed, watershed, sub-basin, basin, etc.)\n",
    "    - this steps ensures that the spatial join in the next step is effective at capturing attribution in the appropriate granularity\n",
    "- the newly split contours are then spatially joined against `fc_watershed` in `mem_contours_sj_water`\n",
    "- `mem_contours_sj_water` is then spatially joined against `fc_grid` in `mem_contours_sj_grid`\n",
    "- then sort the Contour geometry by: grid, hydrological unit, contour elevation, shape\n",
    "    - this forces the drawing per grid/hydro unit area providing better performance when zoomed in\n",
    "- for a clean-up operation, delete fields removes all the extra fields created during processing\n",
    "- finally export the feature class from the `\"memory\"` environment back to the file geodatabse\n",
    "- the loop deletes all `\"memory\"` features to re-allocate memory and initiates another cycle of the loop based on the input list\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes\n",
